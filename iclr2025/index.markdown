# Machine Learning for Remote Sensing

This workshop promotes trans-disciplinary research through diverse view-points to tackle the pressing questions of our times, such as climate change, social inequalities, biodiversity, and food security. 
Developing modern machine learning approaches tailored towards remote sensing data is key to investigating these problems efficiently. This third Machine Learning for Remote Sensing (ML4RS) workshop promotes this exchange by allowing researchers to present their research on environmentally and societally important applications and/or  innovative methods that can have an impact in such application domains. 

## Call for Papers

### Important Dates
- Submission Deadline - TBD
- Acceptance Notification - TBD
- Workshop - April 27th or 28th, 2025

### Topics

We solicit research papers addressing advancements in key topics in Machine Learning for Remote Sensing, such as **domain adaptation**, **concept drift**, **out-of-distribution detection**, **evaluation using unlabeled data**, **model architectures for remote sensing data**, **semi-supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, **self-supervised learning**, **multi-fidelity data fusion**, **federated learning**, **data-centric AI**, **human-in-the-loop** and **active learning**, machine learning for **time series**, methods for **learning from limited labeled data** (e.g., few-shot learning, meta-learning), new **benchmark datasets** involving remote sensing data, **geographic equity**, and **fairness**. 

We welcome applications related to **sustainable development**, **societal needs**, **planetary exploration**, and **more**, including but not limited to **agriculture** and **food security**, **forestry**, **biodiversity** and **species distribution modeling**, **natural hazards** and **disasters**, and other societal and environmental questions. 

Papers can present methodological innovations designed towards a particular problem or can also apply existing methods when they highlight new perspectives or limitations on existing methods or the broader environmental and societal applicability through a particular dataset or impact area.


## Keynote speakers

- [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/) is an Associate Professor of Computer Science in the CS Department at Stanford University where he is affiliated with the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. His research is centered on techniques for probabilistic modeling of data and is motivated by applications in the emerging field of computational sustainability. He has won several awards, including multiple Best Paper Awards, a NSF Career Award, ONR and AFOSR Young Investigator Awards, Microsoft Research Fellowship, Sloan Fellowship, and the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award. Stefano earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell University in 2015.
- [Dit-Yan Yeung](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/dyyeung) received his BEng degree in electrical engineering, MPhil degree in computer science from the University of Hong Kong (HKU), and PhD degree in computer science from the University of Southern California (USC). He started his academic career as an Assistant Professor at the Illinois Insitute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago. Later he joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) where he is currently a Chair Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
